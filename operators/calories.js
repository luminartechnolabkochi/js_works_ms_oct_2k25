// 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) - 161 for ​(woman)
// To determin​e your total daily calorie needs, multiply your BMR by the appropriate activity factor, as follows:

//     If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2
//     If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days​/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375
//     If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55
//     If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725
//     If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9
//     For example If you are sedentary, and your BMR equal 1745 so the total number of calories you need in order to maintain your current weight = 1745*1.2 = 2094.
